
version 0.1

Cell behavior
-Added default cell type (pink), wich generates energy over time
-Added splitting of cells, when the collected energy is sufficient, giving new life costs energy
-Added coolling time between posseble splitting
-Added max life time for cells and cell death upon reaching the age limit
-Added dead cell type (white), wich not generates energy

UI
- Added world status to console output (showing total cells generated, alive cells and dead cells)

==============================================================================
version 0.2 (23.03.2020)

Environment
- Added environment generation with two walls and bottom slab, all resizable
- Using gravity is possible and will not break core simulation

Cell behavior
- Added dying process, which reduce cell density (mass/size ratio) and changes color smoothly
- Added resizing: cell mass and size will increase or decrease according accumulated energy
- Added birth process: new child cell will appear inside parent cell and gradually separate from it. 
- During birth process energy generaion and other possible actions are blocked fo both child and parent

Grafics and FX
- Added nice look to cells
